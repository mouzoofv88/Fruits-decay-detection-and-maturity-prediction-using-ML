#An Intelligent Fruit Decay Detection and Sorting
Technique using YOLO V4 Algorithm


Application of advanced technologies in the agri-
culture field has been increasing day by day due to their
high accuracy and reduced cost. The real time application of
a automatic harvesting robot involves the detection of level
of ripening of fruits. But the main limitation of vision based
system for the fruit ripen detection is the requirement of
fast data handling system and large memory. The other main
challenges are uneven illumination, non-structural fields and
other unpredictable factors. As the demand for the fruits and
vegetable for the population are increasing it is challenging to
maintain a continuous supply of this items regularly. Hence
the application of intelligent technologies are very essential to
increase the production, avoid wastage and timely harvesting
of ripened fruits. Computer vision and image processing based
techniques had been widely employed for sorting of products,
automatic harvesting, deployment of pesticides and seeds etc. but
those methods have not gained popularity due to its limitations.
In this work, designed a system that detects the damage or
decay in fruits or vegetables in real time using machine learning
algorithms. This system will also be helpful for fruit sellers as they
can sort their products very easily and efficiently. The condition
regarding the state of fruit or vegetable is indicated on the LCD
display. This system will be more helpful for farmers, as the
damage and decay of fruit is their prior consideration to impress
the customer and to make a good trade relation. The capability of
the proposed methods has been studied using simulation studies
and implemented in real time successfully.
